This assignment was originally written for an English class; although it ended up not being used and the paper was rewritten with a different topic due to not following instructions. However, needless to say I would like to upload it somewhere for people to read. The paper was uploaded as is and may have grammatical errors, unfinished thoughts, and is overall not complete.

Vitalik Buterin is one of the co-founders of Ethereum, a decentralized mining network with the potential for so much more. Buterin believes in a decentralized future and built the Ethereum framework with this goal in mind. He hopes that Ethereum will develop into the onset of several sociopolitical changes, such as fairer voting systems, urban planning, universal basic income, and public-works projects (Hayward, 2022). While at this point, this is more of a pipedream, these changes could influence the world in a way that regular people could benefit from—more than just people buying yachts and Ferraris and using the network for money laundering and tax evasion.

Born in Russia and emigrated to Canada at a young age, Buterin was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics. At 17, he learned about Bitcoin from his father (Locke 2022). After high school, he joined the University of Waterloo and took several advanced courses, and was a research assistant for a cryptographer. In 2014, he published the original whitepaper that proposed Ethereum (Buterin 2014). A whitepaper is a report that informs readers about a complex issue and the author’s philosophy on the matter (Hayes 2021). He dropped out of the University of Waterloo in 2014 after receiving a grant of $100,000 and began to work full-time on Ethereum (Locke 2022).

In an interview with TIME author Chow (2022b), he talks briefly about his experience with World of Warcraft, an online roleplaying game, and how the company that created the game reduced the power of his character and pushed him away from the game in 2010. After Buterin’s character was nerfed, he said it was an awakening for him on the downsides of a centralized service (Cointelegraph 2021). A few years later, he released the whitepaper for Ethereum and a decentralized network where democracy would hopefully reign supreme.

Ethereum is a “blockchain-based platform that encompasses a range of features” (Soulsby 2018). Ethereum’s goal is a private, peer-to-peer network, “the world’s programmable blockchain” (Ethereum.org n.d.). This was done with a general scripting language that built intelligent contracts, a runtime environment, a digital currency, decentralized finance, decentralized apps, and more all into the network. (Soulsby 2019). Because Ethereum is a blockchain, it comes with all the benefits of blockchain, including transparency, reduced costs, and immutability (Pratt 2022). This means that it can be applied to almost every level of society, from education, healthcare, shipping, the web, and finances.

Buterin is a philosopher working towards bettering the people’s lives around him. Despite all the popularity Ethereum, and even himself, has garnered, he remains humble and concerned about changing people’s lives. His goal is to create a countermeasure to authoritarian governments and upend our digital information’s stranglehold by Big Tech (Chow 2022a). He says that “if we don’t exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable, and those are often far from what’s best for the world.” (Marinoff 2022) He’s an activist, working on becoming less neutral and taking more risks (Locke 2022). He’s donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants toward relief efforts and has publicly spoken out against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine (Lau 2022).

One of the most prominent aspects of Ethereum that Buterin has spoken out against is Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs for short. While he does not hate some larger NFTs, he wants them to “fund public goods” (Hayward 2022). In an interview with Chow (2022b), he talks about how he is worried about “overeager investors, the soaring transaction fees, and the shameless displays of wealth” that frequently dominates what most people know about crypto. He says that the “peril is you have these $3 million monkeys, and it becomes a different kind of gambling.” Although he does mention in the interview with Chow (2022a) that “a lot of good things can come from it.” He specifies that charities, starving artists, and people who can benefit from NFTs are his hopes for the service.

While Buterin may be one of the co-founders of Ethereum, he is not the leader of Ethereum but just a cog in the decentralized platform that anyone can shape, including builders, investors, and the community (BI India 2022). He acts as a philosopher of crypto, and some go further to say that he is the “Prince of Crypto.” But Buterin is dedicated and focused on researching and improving society. He’s important because while he may not be the key to the future, he’s amongst the people holding a potential key to the future. He is fighting for what is right and is working for what is best for the world. I want to write about him because I identify with many of his core values as a co-founder of Ethereum and respect him for his outlook on crypto as more than just a sea of million-dollar crypto apes.
