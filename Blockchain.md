In today’s society, crypto and cryptocurrencies have been a bit of a buzzword. Everyone wants to get rich quickly through non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or buy the next big coin; what if there was more to crypto than just the profitability?

I believe that crypto should be second to the Blockchain, not the other way around. Let me clarify; I don’t have a problem with people investing money into crypto to make money. That is part of what this is all about. However, there is a point where it becomes too far, and a yacht club is unnecessary. I would like to see more contributions to public goods, such as education, healthcare, public transportation, or even artists attempting to sell their art as NFTs to pay for food.

In reality, that’s what crypto should have always been about. Let the marginalized communities gain access to a financial system they were largely unable to access. Take, for example, the people fleeing Ukraine due to the war. While I won’t go into the politics of the situation here on this site, I would like to point out that cryptocurrency has allowed people to quickly and safely keep their life savings and prevent them from being left without any money. Primarily this is the case with stablecoins.

Since a stablecoin is pegged at some commodity or an amount that holds value in our current society, individuals and small businesses can accept and use cryptocurrencies. It is far too “risky” to use a standard cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) in day-to-day transactions. I don’t think these currencies are necessarily dangerous to use, but simply because their values are too volatile. Just like a transaction between fiat currencies are costly, and the importance of that exchange changes frequently, so does the fiat value to the cryptocurrency.

But this still only barely scratches the surface of the possible use-case scenarios for crypto, particularly blockchains. The Blockchain could solve many of the issues that we experience on a daily that we may not necessarily realize. However, the problem with Blockchain is that it only truly functions in a democracy. While this on its own is not an issue, it becomes an issue with the apathy that is becoming more prevalent in our society.

Naturally, this will cause an issue for societies that do not attempt to participate in the Blockchain and could easily lead to a dystopian nightmare. However, the communities and cultures that do take part in the Blockchain will benefit and, in my opinion, become a beacon of light for the future.
