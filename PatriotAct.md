Abstract

On September 11th, 2001, a series of coordinated attacks by terrorist organization Al-Qaeda was committed against the United States. These attacks would be remembered in infamy as 9/11, and nearly 3,000 people were killed on that day. This attack would be remembered for years after it occurred, but the long-lasting effects on the people were not the attack itself, but the Act that was passed afterwards. In the wake of the devastation, the PATRIOT Act was passed with overwhelming bipartisanship, that gave law enforcement new tools to help prevent terrorism. However, some of the laws included in the PATRIOT Act allowed for authorities to monitor communications, collect banking and credit records, and track innocent Americans. Most Americans believe that it was created to prevent terrorism, but it could also take away a basic human right: privacy in the digital age. 

On September 11th, the militant group Al-Qaeda hijacked four planes and carried out suicide missions against the United States. The first two planes were flown into the Twin Towers, the third plane hit the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. This triggered significant changes to the United States and how the military combatted terrorism. The first plane, an American Airlines Boeing 767 loaded with 20,000 gallons of jet fuel, crashed into the northern tower at 8:45am. This impact would leave a massive hole near the 80th floor, where hundreds of people were killed instantaneously, and it trapped even more people in higher floors. 18 minutes later, the second Boeing 767 carved its way into the south tower’s 60th floor. This crash would apparently cause a massive explosion, showering rubble onto nearby buildings and onlookers on the streets below. An hour later, a plane crashed into the west side of the Pentagon and into the field in Pennsylvania. In total, over 3,000 people were killed and over 25,000 people were nonfatally injured (History.com Editors, September 11 Attacks 2010).

The PATRIOT Act is a 300-page document passed by Congress with overwhelming bipartisanship and signed into law by the 43rd President, George W. Bush, on October 26th, 2001. The PATRIOT Act, as observed by the Department of Justice, expanded on the implementation of tools that were already being used against other forms of domestic crime. The goal of the act was to enhance homeland security by “allowing law enforcement to use surveillance and wiretapping to investigate terror-related crimes, allowing federal agents to request court permission to use roving wiretaps to track a specific terrorist suspect” and more. Some of these changes directly benefits homeland security, such as allowing federal agents the use of roving wiretaps when tracking international terrorists and organized crime who are trained to avoid surveillance by changing locations and communication devices rapidly. These improvements allowed for law enforcement to have increased power to act quickly before an attack is successfully completed. Increasing the speed of inquiries made about suspicious activities strengthened the prevention of terrorism and helped coordinate the arrest of potential terrorists (History.com Editors, Patriot Act 2017). 

However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the Act gave the United States’ Government the ability to investigate anyone it sees fit. This was in direct conflict with one of the greatest American values, the right to privacy. Misuse of the Act also has led to suspected terrorists being imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and other black sites without legal representation and breaching their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. While this does not always affect normal citizens, it does for people who do business overseas by increasing prices or opening for more difficulties for mundane situations (Chen, USA Patriot Act 2020). 

The PATRIOT Act was built on Bill Clinton’s “Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty act of 1996,” which made it much easier for authorities to establish and prosecute terrorists, whether it was domestically or internationally. At the time, Congress refused to broaden the access to personal records in cases relating to terrorism because they felt it was unconstitutional (Chen, USA Patriot Act 2020). This bill would prevent prisoners from habeas corpus, or the right to challenge their custody. This bill has prevented prisoners from making a case for their wrongful conviction has become the main obstruction in their cases (Segura, The Inside Story of How Bill Clinton Sacrificed Prisoners’ Rights for Political Gain 2016).

The USA Freedom Act was passed to place restrictions and oversights on the government’s surveillance powers. Yet another act of overwhelming bipartisanship, it was the first act in over thirty years that both Houses of Congress approved of a bill. After Edward Snowden’s evidence of surveillance abuse, Congress was given a chance to change extensive surveillance reform and have a thorough investigative of the abuse of powers (Reitman, USA Freedom Act Passes: What We Celebrate, What We Mourn, and Where We Go From Here 2015). Human privacy remains one of the most important rights and with the ever-changing field that is information communications and technology, it’s “become clear that these new technologies are vulnerable to electronic surveillance and interception.” This form of surveillance tends to put pressure on the individual rights of expression and association and prevents the function of a vivid civil society (Right to Privacy in the Digital Age).

In summary, the PATRIOT Act was an overreaching but a step in the right direction. By increasing the power that government organizations have, while also adding in checks and balances to keep the system from tipping too far in either direction. Protecting American citizen and property is a top priority, second only to ensuring that the human right to privacy and due process are not breached by the system that the American population is supposed to trust.
